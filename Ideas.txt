Ideas:
- Unique Bracket page for playoffs, maybe others?? (use firebase to pull data, mimic react rendering)
- user firebase/realtime database to display playoffname through ID
- Update Playoffs page
- Clone roomy //Note: 2019.10.01 (was i on crack wtf even is that??) //2019.11.12 (still no clue hah)
- Perform testing, Number function is wrong :(
- Check ID's
- Calculate Scores for Playoffs
- Damn you chrome and your cookie protection for local files
